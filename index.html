<h1>About Visual Studio</h1>
<p1>Visual Studio is a free coding application. It has many diffirent coding languages to choose from. Right now we are working on 
Javascript and HTML. In Javascript you can create variables which can hold values. You can also use functions which can change the 
variables value it is holding. In HTML, you design the apps structure, such as the header, or this very paragraph. Now, there i one
more thing that we are working with, and it is the console. Remember how I talked about variables? Well, you can log variables into the
console. If there is something wrong with your code and your not getting the output you want, if you log in the variable that you were
using, the console can tell you whats wrong. This process is called debugging. now, if you want to see all this code, right click
anywhere on this website and click inspect. This will allow you to see the HTML, Javascript, and Console. Go on, try it!</p1>
